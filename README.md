## ⛰ The **Quest: Build a Basic Editor**

For the quest, you will build a _very basic_ design editor using React. Users must be able to add, drag, and remove elements in the editor.

There are many different ways to scope and implement a solution. We recommend keeping it simple.

- Use React to render the elements in the DOM (do not use canvas).
- The editor should not persist state (no API, no local storage).
- Performance is not important – the editor only needs to be capable of handling a handful of elements.

### Requirements

- You must use the `create-react-app` utility to set up the project.
- You must build the drag-functionality yourself. Do not use libraries such as `react-draggable`.
