ðŸ™ŒÂ  Thank you for participating in this quest! Are you ready for an adventure? Let's get started!

_Why do we have quests?_ We use them to:

1. To understand your skill level and how you approach tasks. We want to make sure that you have the core skills to set you up for success as a future uizard ðŸ§™, while still giving you plenty of room to take on challenges.
2. For you to decide if itâ€™s the right role for you. Itâ€™s important to us that youâ€™ll love what youâ€™ll do and be able to explore new ideas and opportunities.

## âœ…Â **Instructions for Your Quest:**

- Complete the quest and submit your solution. Youâ€™re welcome to submit it as soon as you are done, we evaluate submissions continuously.
- Email us the solution by sending a single zip-file with the source code (without `node_modules` folder). If you have issues sending it as an attachment, please use a service like [wetransfer](http://wetransfer.com) to upload the zip and send the download link.
- After you hand in the challenge, we will review your submission and get back to you with next steps by email.

## â›°Â The **Quest: Build a Basic Editor**

For the quest, you will build a _very basic_ design editor using React. Users must be able to add, drag, and remove elements in the editor.

There are many different ways to scope and implement a solution. We recommend keeping it simple.

- Use React to render the elements in the DOM (do not use canvas).
- The editor should not persist state (no API, no local storage).
- Performance is not important â€“ the editor only needs to be capable of handling a handful of elements.

If youâ€™re comfortable with TypeScript, we encourage you to use it, but it is not a requirement.

### Requirements

- You must use the `create-react-app` utility to set up the project.
- You must build the drag-functionality yourself. Do not use libraries such as `react-draggable`.
